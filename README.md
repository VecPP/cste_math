# cste_math

constexpr scalar math

## Origin

cste_math was spun off from [VecPP](https://github.com/VecPP/vecpp). The
distinction between compile-time and runtime algorithms was getting messy, so
isolating the constexpr algorithms was needed. We decided we might as well make 
it a distinct repository.
